# Performance Optimization

## Model Selection Strategy

**Sonnet 4** (Best coding model):
- Main development work
- Orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- Complex coding tasks

**Opus 4.5** (Deepest reasoning):
- Complex architectural decisions
- Maximum reasoning requirements
- Research and analysis tasks


## When to Use Plan Mode

Use Plan Mode for:
- Multi-file changes
- Architectural decisions
- Unclear or ambiguous requirements
- Tasks requiring exploration before implementation
